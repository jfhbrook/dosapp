# Turbo Pascal 7.0

## Setup

### TURBO vs TPX

Turbo Pascal contains an alternative IDE called `tpx`. To enable it, set
`TURBO_PASCAL_BIN` in Turbo Pascal's `dosapp.env`.

### Disks

DOSBox will prompt you to swap disks. The shortcut for this is ctrl-F4.
Alternatively, go to the menu bar, select "Drive" -> "A" -> "Swap Disk".

### Configuration

Turbo Pascal's installer will show the following warning:
```
Make sure the line
  FILES = 20
is in your CONFIG.SYS file, and C:\TP\BIN is in
your path. For example, to run any of the Turbo
Pascal programs or utilities from anywhere on
your system, your AUTOEXEC.BAT file could
contain a path like the following:
  PATH=C:\DOS:C:\TP\BIN

      Press any key to view the README file.
```

Both of these settings are included in the autoexec configuration for starting
Turbo Pascal in dosapp. You should not need to worry about this.

### Turbo Pascal README

If you need to refer to Turbo Pascal's README at a future date, it is stored
at `C:\TP\README`.
